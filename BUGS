Botnik bugs
===========

Serious shit
============
* Timer events happen even when botnik is disconnected. This may cause him to try to send data on a closed socket => crash.
* The title reader can freeze sometimes. I think this is because the httpreader module is a little buggy.
* shuting down the bot probably results in on_unload not being run => no saved states

* Odd stuff:
