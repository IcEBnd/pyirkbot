Small howto for getting started without loosing your hair:

copy the file setting.sample.py > settings.py
edit network-name and the network address and all stuff there...
including the admin network and stuff, this is where you control the bot

make sure you enable all the cool plugins, there are alot of them and they are not enabled by default....

now you are ready to start the bot:
pyton main.py

happy botting
